                <p>
                This morning, I awoke to a world subtly changed, 
                a shadow had passed over it. 
                An old friend that I have known since childhood passed away.
                It hit me like a punch from a giant. 
                It’s a strange feeling that sits in your stomach, heavy, unwelcome. 
                We were close. The kind of close that stitches pieces of your lives together.
                Once upon a time… A piece of my past, a part of my story, 
                a hole in the patchwork that can’t be mended.
                </p>
                <p>
                It’s a helpless sort of sadness. I’ve been trying to wrap my head around it,
                to find some sort of sense or narrative in the irony of fates. 
                But the heart doesn’t always listen to reason, 
                it remembers the laughter, the adventures, the times we argued and made up.
                They are not here any more, and it’s like trying to hear a song that’s just finished playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                I’m finding it hard to hold on to the normal, the now. 
                I’m hoping that pouring my thoughts and feelings into 
                this journal will provide a kind of magic that’ll help to put things in order.
                At least for me. It’s a way of holding onto the memories, 
                of painting them in words so they are less likely to fade into the background.
                I know they’d want me to remember the good days, and to keep on keeping on, 
                in a world that’s a little darker for their leaving.

                I went to Alex’s funeral. 
                There I stood, amidst the mourning shadows, 
                my heart heavy with the weight of a grief that clung like ivy. 
                The sadness was palpable, filling every corner of the room.
                The service was touching, and hearing everyone’s kind words 
                and memories eased my pain somewhat.
                </p>
                <p>    
                After the service, I was graciously invited to my friend’s parent’s <font color="#004D80">house</font>. 
                It was like stepping into our shared past, full of laughter and fun. 
                Never I thought I’d be saying goodbye so soon. 
                There I sat for coffee with their family. 
                Our conversation meandered through a landscape of happier times. 
                A nostalgic stroll down the memory lane, each anecdote a cherished echo of our past.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                As the sun started to set, I had to go home. 
                Before I went, Alex's parents presented me with a collection of some 
                of Alex’s cherished possessions. 
                Among them, I found a stack of old video games, 
                their cases worn from the countless hours we had lost ourselves in. 
                They also handed me their laptop, and entrusted me with is contents, 
                saying I was the one who probably could make the best use of it. 
                They asked for a simple exchange: any photographs of Alex
                that I might uncover within its depth, they wished to have.
                </p>
                <p>    
                Clutching these pieces of a life interrupted, 
                I was swept into a tide of bittersweet gratitude. 
                These artefacts, now my charge, were more than mere objects, 
                they were the keys to the treasury of our shared past. 
                    
                I don’t have the mental energy to turn it on today though.

                <p>
                Today, I took a deep breath and finally summoned 
                the courage to turn on Alex’s laptop. 
                As the screen hummed to life, 
                it was as if I had entered a minimalist version of their existence. 
                The desktop was eerily clean, 
                only a couple of folders and icons were visible, 
                a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos that was my friend.
                It felt like a ghostly echo of their life, curated and controlled.
                </p>
                <p>
                My first task was to fulfil the promise I had made to their parents.
                I navigated to their image folder,
                expecting to be hit by a wave of memories consisting of selfies,
                random images downloaded from the internet,
                or memes that we shared to each others. 
                But no, it was a sparse collection. 
                Only a handful of photos, each one a carefully snapshot of their life.
                I saved these onto a usb stick. 
                A small but I'm sure invaluable collection to share with their family. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                One of the folder on the desktop was simply called ‘scripts’. 
                It was filled with the scripts they wrote for their Youtube channel. 
                I clicked a few of them of which I recognised the titles. 
                I read for a bit, their voice resonating through each word. 
                I could hear their passion, the enthusiasm that would never again fill a room.
                </p>
                <p><s>
                I also found something a bit more unexpected, 
                a folder titled ‘ai’. 
                It contained a series of abstract drawing (painting?). 
                They were not the vibrant, chaotic images I was expecting. 
                Instead, these were darker, almost melancholic. 
                The shapes were heavy, the colors muted. Here and there, 
                the shapes would stumble each others to make something appear: 
                a city, a ware<font color="#004D80">house</font>, a landfill?
                </s></p>
                <p>    
                The curated emptiness of their laptop was unsettling. 
                It was as if they had left behind only what they wanted the world to remember, 
                a controlled narrative. 
                It was an echo of him, 
                but also a reminder of the depths that often lay hidden beneath the surface. 
                Tomorrow, I'll share the photos with their family. 
                Tonight, I sit with the heavy silence, their words echoing in my mind,
                and the haunting images of their artworks.

                Visited Alex's parents today. 
                I handed them the flash drive, apologising for the delay.
                They simply nodded, understanding etched in their eyes. 
                Words felt superfluous. 
                We shared a quiet moment, 
                holding onto the silence as we all navigated our grief. 
                Sometimes, understanding doesn't need words, just presence.

                Today, I braced myself and opened the laptop once more. 
                The quiet hum of the machine felt like a heartbeat, 
                a lifeline to the world Alex left behind. 
                I navigated back to the 'scripts' folder. 
                The documents stared back at me, frozen in digital time 
                - their thoughts, their words, their voice. 
                They were like vessels, carrying fragments of 
                their spirit within the intricately woven sentences.
                </p>
                <p>
                I opened one that was last modified the day before their passing 
                - an unfinished script titled "Scrap Metal: The Lost Sound of the 90s". 
                Intrigued, I began to read and soon found myself immersed in an internet mystery. 
                Alex had been investigating a genre from the 90s called "Scrap Metal".
                Their writing was filled with palpable curiosity, 
                the excitement of a treasure hunt that they were known to love.
                </p>
                <p>  
                Their script was a testament to the power of a community pulling together,
                piecing together fragmented information and half-forgotten memories.
                The shared enthusiasm and collective knowledge of an online community,
                dedicated to uncovering the lost sound of Scrap Metal, 
                was palpable in their words.
                </p>
                <p>  
                The script was raw, sketchy, full of ideas and tangents yet to be explored.
                The leads they were yet to follow, the songs they were yet to discover.
                It was like a puzzle with missing pieces, a melody longing for its crescendo.
                </p>
                <p> 
                As the last line of the unfinished script faded into the digital ether,
                it felt like an unfinished melody, hanging in the air with a note of anticipation. 
                A story left half-told. A journey cut short. 
                Alex's passion for the subject was evident,
                and it felt almost unjust to leave this script unfinished, this mystery unsolved.
                </p>
                <p>   
                In the quiet of the night, I made a decision. 
                I would pick up where they left off. I would finish the script. 
                For Alex, for their community, for the forgotten sounds of Scrap Metal. 
                I would follow the breadcrumbs they had left behind, diving into this internet mystery,
                and write the ending that they had envisioned. 
                Maybe it was a way to keep their voice alive, to make sure their echo resonated a little longer.
                Tonight, I sit with the weight of responsibility, 
                their words resonating in my mind, and the unfinished script that waits for closure.

                <p>
                The past few days have been spent in quiet contemplation, 
                trying to make sense of the unfinished script. 
                Alex's words, their thoughts, are like pieces of a complex puzzle, 
                each one a fragment of the bigger picture they were trying to paint.
                The script, in its raw form, is like an intricate <font color="red"><s>labyrinth</s></font>. 
                Ideas branch out like roots, growing in a multitude of directions, 
                each one a possible path to explore.
                I'd assumed that diving into the script would be straightforward,
                a simple matter of following the breadcrumbs they'd left behind.
                But the task has proven to be more daunting than I had anticipated.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Today, I spent hours poring over the script, 
                tracing the threads of their thoughts and trying to follow their train of ideas.
                Their excitement for the topic is evident in each line.
                The information, however, is fragmented, the narrative disjointed. 
                It's much like trying to listen to a song with intermittent signal 
                - the melody is there, but the gaps are noticeable.
                </p>
                <p>     
                It's clear that the script is only a part of the story. 
                To truly understand it, I need to immerse myself in the world Alex was exploring,
                to see this mystery through their eyes. 
                And to do that, I need to go where they went 
                - the online communities that they were a part of, 
                the digital meeting grounds where the hunt for Scrap Metal took place.

                Last night, the line between reality and illusion blurred 
                as I found myself lost in a dream, or rather, a nightmare. 
                The world within my mind was a haunting echo of the world 
                I've been exploring these past days, 
                a surreal reflection of Alex's digital realm.
                </p>
                <p>
                I found myself standing outside Alex's <font color="#004D80">house</font>. 
                It was eerily quiet, the silence only punctuated by the distant hum of the city.
                The <font color="#004D80">house</font> was as I remembered it, yet it seemed to pulsate with a strange energy,
                as if it were an entity of its own. 
                Anxiety gnawed at the edges of my consciousness, 
                a ghostly reminder of the loss and the journey I've embarked on.
                </p>
                <p>
                Stepping inside, itwas empty, devoid of the usual warmth and familiarity.
                The walls were bare, except for the dark gloomy abstract painting. 
                They seemed alive, the shapes shifting and morphing, 
                the colors pulsating with an intensity that was almost hypnotic.
                The images were unsettling, the heavy shapes, the muted colors, 
                the vague forms all seemed to bleed into each other.
                </p>
                <p> 
                I could hear the hum of their laptop in the background, 
                a constant, ominous soundtrack that filled the empty <font color="#004D80">house</font>. 
                The sound was heavy, pressing down on me, 
                fueling the anxiety that was already simmering beneath the surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                Suddenly, Alex was there. But they were not the Alex I remembered. 
                Their eyes were distant, their expression vacant. 
                They were there, yet they seemed a million miles away. 
                They didn't speak, didn't acknowledge my presence. 
                They were just there, a ghostly echo of the friend I lost.
                I reached out to them, but as my hand got closer, 
                they began to disintegrate, pixel by pixel, like an image losing its resolution.
                I watched in horror as my friend dissolved into a cloud of digital particles,
                their form scattering into the abstract artwork on the walls.

                Today marks my first foray into the online communities 
                where Alex was a part of the hunt for the elusive Scrap Metal genre.
                It was a journey into the unknown, 
                a dive into the digital underworld that they were so deeply entrenched in.
                </p>
                <p>
                My first stop was the subreddit mentioned in the script.
                To my surprise, it was a private subreddit, 
                a secluded corner of the internet hidden away from prying eyes. 
                I realized I had access to it because I was logged into Alex's account on their computer.
                I was, in a sense, stepping into their digital shoes.
                The subreddit was a labyrinth of discussions, ideas, 
                and theories, much like the script itself. 
                There was a wealth of information to sift through. 
                But what struck me was the sense of community. 
                This wasn't just a place for sharing information; 
                it was a gathering place for a tightly-knit group of enthusiasts, 
                bound together by their shared facination for Scrap Metal.
                </p>
                <p>   
                Next, I ventured into their Discord. 
                This, too, was a private server, 
                a digital sanctuary for the Scrap Metal hunters, 
                to which I had access since Alex was still logged in.
                (I set the setting to be invisible in Discord,
                I didn't want anyone to freak out my seeing Alex connected.)
                Here, their interactions were more informal, more personal. 
                They had developed complex relationships, created their own private jokes, 
                and formed traditions over the years. 
                It was a window into a world that felt both strange and familiar, 
                like stepping into a party where you didn't know anyone, but everyone knew you.
                </p>
                <p>   
                This dive into the online communities was a treasure trove of information, 
                but it wasn't going to be easy to navigate. 
                The friendly discussions, while endearing, 
                made it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. 
                The task of unraveling the mystery of Scrap Metal seemed even more daunting now. 
                But it was clear that this was a necessary step. 
                I was walking the path that Alex had tread, 
                trying to see the world through their eyes. 
                And this world was far more intricate, more vibrant than I could have ever imagined.
                </p>
                <p> 
                I can't help but feel a mix of apprehension and excitement.
                There's so much to learn, so much to uncover. This is just the beginning.

                <p>
                    Fuck’s sake! I just realized it's November already 
                    - two months since my last entry. 
                    Time has a way of slipping through your fingers 
                    when you're buried in work and deep dives to catch up with  the internet's underbelly.
                    My regular work is demanding enough, 
                    but I've been spending every available moment 
                    - my evenings, my nights, a few hours of the morning - 
                    exploring the uncovered archives of Scrap Metal. 
                    It felt like navigating an endless maze with no clear way out,
                    only the promise of potential clues and revelations. 
                    The sheer volume of noise was overwhelming and sometimes, 
                    it felt like I was a tiny boat lost in an ocean of internet chatter, trying to stay afloat.
                    Despite all this, I couldn't help but be pulled in by the allure of the mystery.
                    Each piece of information felt like a puzzle piece, 
                    and I was determined to assemble the pieces, no matter how long it took. 
                    The allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, was too strong to resist.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    But I digress. The reason I finally came back to my diary is 
                    because of something rather special that happened yesterday. 
                    The Discord server held a unique event. One of their yearly tradition. 
                    The members live streamed each other, across the globe, 
                    performing their interpretations of Scrap Metal. 
                    It was a fascinating break from the usual exchange of tracks 
                    and algorithm-generated album covers that is the norm in the #landfill channel.
                    To see them, in their own spaces, 
                    individually contributing to the genre they loved 
                    so passionately was an experience that words can hardly do justice. 
                    The energy was infectious; the community, vibrant. 
                    I felt like I was part of something much larger than myself.
                    Their creativity, their passion, their dedication 
                    - it was tangible, even through the digital divide. 
                    It was a poignant reminder of why I was on this journey in the first place. 
                    Alex loved this community, this genre. They were part of it. 
                    And as I watched the performances, I felt closer to understanding Alex, 
                    and why Scrap Metal meant so much to them.
                    It's late now, and there is still much to do, but I feel reinvigorated, 
                    more determined than ever to continue my journey into the heart of Scrap Metal.

                    The world of Scrap Metal, once an elusive enigma, 
                    is now sprawled in stacks of notes and transcripts across my desk. 
                    It's like stargazing in a room filled with constellations of paper. 
                    And within those celestial bodies of information, 
                    I believe, I have enough to complete the script.
                    But this script is more than just words on a page. 
                    It has to be a tribute, a homage to the unique lens 
                    through which Alex viewed the world. 
                    I've been trying to capture the essence of their style.
                    The ideas are there, floating like ghost ships in the fog of my mind. 
                    But the words, those elusive creatures, seem to play coy. 
                    I've considered seeking the help of AI, but that feels like a shortcut,
                    a digital detour that might rob the script of its humanity. 
                    The weight of the task is a constant companion, like a stone in my pocket.
                    The fear of not being enough is a spectre that lurks in the corners of my mind,
                    casting long shadows of doubt.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Last night, I passed out on my desk whilst working on the script. 
                    I dreamt of Alex. We were at a Scrap Metal concert, 
                    in a sea of sound and light, our hearts beating to the rhythm of the music.
                    It was a beautiful nightmare, a compensatory memory of what was and what could have been.
                    Awakening to the silence of the morning,
                    the echoes of the dream concert still rang in my ears, 
                    a phantom melody that was both a lullaby and a dirge. 
                    The dream, the music, Alex - they're all strands of the same thread,
                    weaving a tapestry of memories and emotions.

                    I find myself lost in all of these scattered notes, 
                    fading transcripts and nebulous memories. 
                    Time has started to blur, like a watercolor painting left out in the rain. 
                    The ticking of the clock has been replaced by the rustling of papers, the tapping of keys.
                    I woke up today, or was it yesterday, to find two versions of the script on my computer.
                    One, a testament of my conscious efforts, painstakingly pieced together from fragments of thoughts.
                    The other, a mystery, a phantom script that seemed to have materialized from the ether.
                    I can't recall writing it, yet there it was, in my style.
                    It was like staring into a mirror and not recognizing the reflection.
                    This second script, it's different. It's raw, unfiltered, like a wound that's yet to heal. 
                    It's brutally honest, painfully real. 
                    It's a deep dive into the heart of Alex, into the heart of Scrap Metal. 
                    It's a script that bares its soul, a script that screams and whispers at the same time. 
                    It's a script that feels like it was written by Alex, for Alex.
                    I don't remember writing it, but it feels like mine. 
                    It feels like it's the script I've been trying to write, the script I've been failing to write. 
                    It's a haunting symphony of words that seems to capture the essence of Alex. 
                    But how did it come to be? 
                    Is it the result of my subconscious wrestling with the task while I sleep? 
                    Or is it something else, something more profound, more mystical?
                    I don't know. All I know is, the script is here, it's real. And it's beautiful. It's terrifying. 
                    It's a mirror that reflects the chaos and the calm, the sound and the silence, 
                    the light and the darkness of the world of Scrap Metal. 
                    It's a tribute to Alex, a testament to their legacy. 
                    It's more than just a script, it's a piece of my soul, a piece of Alex's soul. 
                    It's a love letter, a eulogy, a song.
                    I don't know where this journey is taking me.

                    In the cold heart of the night I found myself standing at the mouth of a colossal tunnel its gaping maw swallowing the feeble light around me Its breath was the chilly wind that danced on my skin and whispered ominous tales in my ears The entrance was adorned with rusted scraps an iron garden of twisted metal I ventured into the darkness the echo of my hesitant footsteps my only companion The tunnel stretched into an abyss a serpentine labyrinth of shadows and echoes that seemed to pulse with a life of its own The silence was deafening broken intermittently by the distant groan of the colossal structure a dirge sung by the ghosts of forgotten machines
                    Suddenly the tunnel began to close in on me The walls of rusted metal came alive whispering in the language of screeches and groans They reached for me their cold iron fingers grazing my skin leaving trails of rust and dread I tried to run to escape the closing jaws of this mechanical beast but my feet betrayed me sinking into the cold metal floor, now alive and hungry Then the music started A haunting melody a discordant symphony of metallic clangs and eerie reverberations It surrounded me seeped into me resonating with my racing heartbeat Thetunnelthemusicthefear all merged into one From the depths of the darkness a figure emerged a silhouette carved out of the black void It moved towards me its steps in sync with the dreadful symphony It was Alex Or was it The figure was a grotesque echo of them a puppet made of scrap and shadows dancing to the rhythm of the tunnel's heartbeat Its eyes glowed with a spectral light illuminating the rusted horror around us It reached out its hand a gnarled sculpture of iron and rust I was trapped ensnared in this nightmarish waltz a prisoner in this concert of dread

                <p>
                    I don't know if it's the memories of Alex that keep flooding back 
                    or the sheer magnitude of this project,
                    but I need to take a step back. 
                    What began as a simple cleanup 
                    and release as a memorial has morphed into something 
                    far more consuming, far more demanding. My days and nights 
                    are now woven into the fabric of this script, stitched 
                    together with threads of nostalgia 
                    
                    and grief. The script has become my world, its characters my 
                    companions, its narrative my reality. Hours 
                    
                    pass by
                    , unnoticed, unacknowledged. I look at the clock, and 
                    it's morning; I blink, and suddenly it's night.
                    
                    
                    I find myself lost in a timeless void, 
                    adrift in a sea of words and 
                    
                    emotions.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In an attempt to better understand the 
                    world that Alex was so deeply 
                    entrenched in, 
                    I've been observing the communities on Reddit and Discord. I've been a silent visitor, a 
                    ghost in the digital crowd, 
                    
                    
                    trying to decipher the language, 
                    
                    the nuances,
                    the shared history. But 
                    it's like trying to catch smoke 
                    with bare hands. The more 
                    I try to grasp it, the more it eludes me.
                    The 
                    discussions, the debates, the shared memories and in-jokes - they all swirl
                    around me in a dizzying dance
                    
                    . It's a rich tapestry 
                    of camaraderie and shared passion, but I feel like 
                    an outsider peering in. Despite the countless hours spent perusing 
                    through threads and chat histories, 
                    
                    
                    
                    I still feel like a foreigner lost in a familiar 
                    land.
                </p>







                <p> 


                    And yet, despite 
                    the countless hours poured into this script, I find myself standing on foreign ground each time I return to 
                    it. New pieces of the script, 
                    born out of the ether, stare back at me from the screen. 
                    They're mine, yet unfamiliar, like old memories reshaped by the passage 
                    of time. I'm caught in the
                    
                    undertow of this
                    project, pulled under by its relentless 
                    current, and I fear I 
                    might be
                    
                    
                    losing 

                    myself 

                    in 
                    
                    the 
                    
                    process. 
                    
                    
                    I see Alex in every line, hear their 








                    
                    voice in every word, feel their presence in every scene. It's a comforting yet haunting experience, 











                    a constant reminder of the void left by their departure.

                    to escape the confines of this script, to remember who I am beyond the pages of this memorial. I need to distance
                    myself from the world of Scrap
                    Metal, from the ghost of Alex, from this script. So, I'm going to stop for a while.
                    I'm going to step out of the world I've built around this script, into the reality I've neglected.

                    At last, the journey has reached its end. 
                    The script, a testament to Alex and to the world of Scrap Metal, is complete. 
                    Tomorrow, I will share this labor of love with Alex’s followers, 
                    and with the Scrap Metal community. 
                    I’m making a GitHub depository of all the documents.

                    I swear I uploaded my version of the script. 
                    But the one on the depot seems to be the wrong one. 
                    I tried to change it, but I don’t seem to be able to push on the depot anymore.
